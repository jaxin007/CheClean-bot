# CheClean ![Project-logo](docs/CheClean-logo.png)

## The goal of this project is to make Cherkasy cleaner and better. The bot helps deliver garbage places location to cleaner utilities.

When you send the `/create` command, the bot asks you to give a description, photo, and location of the garbage place that you found. After all these steps, it will gather all the data collected and send it to our database, where the administrator of the utility company will manage all cases and send them to the companies for cleaning.
